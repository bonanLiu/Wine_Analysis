0,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This LBV Port is powered by jammy damson and plum fruits along with dried figs and a juicy aftertaste. The palate is dry, with tannins just in evidence, although the balance is just right. Drink now. ",Delaforce 2011 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),89,20,Port,Port, 2011
1,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This wine has richness, with fine tannins along with exuberant fruit. With its concentration and ripe berry flavors it has power as well as elegance. Juicy and packed with blackberry and damsons, it will be ready to drink from 2026. ",Quevedo 2015 Quinta Vale d'Agodinho Vintage  (Port),93,60,Port,Port, 2015
3,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The wine is rich, exuding ripe black fruits as well as dried prune. It balances the fruit with some firm tannins that will allow the wine to age for a few years. For now, it is opulent, finely balanced, and leaves a fine perfumed aftertaste from the Touriga Nacional in the blend. ",Offley 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),90,26,Port,Port, 2013
5,15.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"This wine's butterscotch and toffee notes precede a citric palate that fails to capture the basics of good Fino: friendly, crisp and clean. This tastes of sour white fruit and citrus, with a hint of nuttiness. On the finish, it goes past crisp and snappy straight to sharp. ",Bodegas Barón NV Micaela Fino Sherry (Jerez),82,11,Andalucia,Sherry,
6,17.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Smooth, rich and easy on the palate, this is a delicious, balanced Sherry. Its nutty, chocolate, mocha and almond flavors finish like a good cup of coffee. ",Pemartín NV Cream Sherry (Jerez),91,14,Andalucia,Sherry,
7,20.0,Port/Sherry,US,"This is made from a majority of Touriga Nacional, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), and spent nearly 11 years in neutral oak before being bottled in 2017. It appears to be in its prime, beautifully rich on the nose and palate, with integrated, off-dry flavors of candied orange and cherry. ",Prager NV Noble Companion 10-Year-Old Tawny Port (Napa Valley),94,80,California,Port,
8,14.0,Red,Portugal,"From a parcel of 45 different old-vine varieties planted mixed in the traditional way, this wine is bold, ripe and richly textured. Partly fermented in open stone lagars, it has a typical, almost Port-like character. Ripe black plums, rich tannins and a great structure all point to medium-term aging potential. Drink from 2022. ",Quinta do Vallado 2015 Reserva Field Blend Red (Douro),94,65,Douro,Portuguese Red, 2015
9,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The wood-aged wine has retained its fruit in the manner of a 10-year-old tawny. While there are plenty of rich red fruits, there is also the layer of wood-aging toast and spice to give the wine an extra dimension. Like all tawnies, this wine is ready to drink. ",Poças 2008 Colheita  (Port),91,40,Port,Port, 2008
10,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The wine is dominated by big bold tannins that give a sense of great power. That produces a wine with a strong structure, and a dry edge that will need to soften. Drink this dark firm wine from 2028. ",Quinta do Vallado 2016 Adelaide Vintage  (Port),94,110,Port,Port, 2016
12,18.0,Port/Sherry,US,"An outstanding after-dinner drink, this wine has a tawny color along the rim and abundant nutty mapley apricot-like flavors. A combination of elevated alcohol, good acidity and firm tannins gives it a grip on the palate and contributes to a long tasty nutty finish. ",Meyer Family Cellars NV Port (California),90,35,California,Port,
13,13.5,Red,Portugal,This ripe wine is packed with attractive black fruits. Its light structure will  allow the wine to be drunk young to benefit from the fruitiness and mineral texture. Drink from 2020. ,Symington Family Estates 2016 Altano Naturalmente Red (Douro),87,12,Douro,Portuguese Red, 2016
14,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is a rich, nutty wine, satisfyingly ripe, poised between sweet and dry. Its touch of spirit adds to the sweetness of the wine and balances with the acidity from wood aging. The wine is ready to drink. ",Dow's NV 10 Years Old Tawny  (Port),90,37,Port,Port,
15,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The latest incarnation of this most famous of Late Bottled Vintage Ports has so many of the brand's characteristics. It is on the dry side, a balanced wine with acidity as well as the sweet black fruits and with some tannins to give the wine shape. The Port is bottled ready for drinking. ",Taylor Fladgate 2014 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),90,25,Port,Port, 2014
16,,Red,Portugal,"A blend of five Douro grapes, several of which go into Port, this has a dusty nose and a palate of warm berries. It's a thick, jammy, pungent wine that expands in the mouth to catch all corners. Aged in French oak for about a year, this wine has the potential to age and become something special. ",Sogrape 1996 Reserva Red (Douro),87,13,Douro,Portuguese Red, 1996
17,,White,Portugal,"An oddity for this bastion of red wines and Port, this unknown white happens to be downright good and is reminiscent of Bordeaux blanc; yet it's made from a blend of fairly obscure Portuguese white varietals. Extremely aromatic, floral and clean, it's loaded with green-apple and lees flavor. Slightly creamy with a pleasant texture, this is one to look for. ",Real Vinicola 1998 Porca de Murça Reserva Red (Douro),89,17,Douro,Red Blends, 1998
18,,Red,US,"A ripe, alcoholic nose, with port-like, raisiny fruit. It seems a little sharp and thin on the palate at this point of its development, with alcohol and tannins overriding the fruit. ",Kenwood 1997 Jack London Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),84,20,California,Zinfandel, 1997
19,14.5,Red,US,"This is tough, chewy Zinfandel; fruity and one-dimensional, with overripe, port-like flavors. ",Norman 1997 The Monster Zinfandel (Paso Robles),84,18,California,Zinfandel, 1997
20,,Red,US,"95-year-old vines produced this dark, inky, tannic wine made in the old style. Blueberries, vanilla and spice, with lots of depth and power. Good juice unimpeded by oak. ",Sonora 1997 TC Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),86,19,California,Zinfandel, 1997
21,,Red,US,"The flavors are almost moving into late-harvest; raisiny, superripe, hot and tannic. On the plus side is the finish, with sweet, juicy, jammy fruit that is really tasty. From 77-year-old vines. ",Sonora 1997 Story Vyd Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),86,19,California,Zinfandel, 1997
22,16.1,Red,US,"The high alcohol (16.1%) indicates ripe, port-like fruit. Raisins and plums fill out a gamy, fat, seriously oaky monster. This is not food-friendly; it's really more of an after-dinner, Friday-night kind of wine. But if you like your Zinfandel over the top in all respects, this is your bottle. ",St. Francis 1997 Pagani Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),88,39,California,Zinfandel, 1997
23,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Perhaps the major surprise is that one of the top wines is a single quinta Port from Sandeman, a house that, after a fairly lean period, is reaffirming its commitment to Vintage Port. This is luscious, rich, almost creamy in texture, with piles of black fruit, lavender and spice. ",Sandeman 1997 Quinta do Vau Port (Douro),93,38,Douro,Port, 1997
24,,Red,US,"Has pretty Zin aromas. Rich and fruity, and becomes almost superripe in the midpalate, where raisiny, overextracted flavors kick in with Port-like intensity and heat. A big wine that's a little off-balance; finishes hot. ",Hidden Mountain Ranch 1997 Zinfandel (California),83,16,California,Zinfandel, 1997
25,13.9,Red,US,"Heady aromas of plums, chocolate, blackberries and raisins. Flavors are fruity, and tannins are considerable, as is the oak. Although the alcohol is only 13.9 percent, it drinks a little like a Port—thick and chewy. Will seem cloying and out of balance to some; others will be thrilled. ",Kendall-Jackson 1996 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (California),89,74,California,Cabernet Sauvignon, 1996
26,20.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A full-bore tawny, it's still going strong, possibly too strong. Rosy in color, there's a faint odor of chlorine to go with the tea and spice aromas. Full-bodied, even a touch heavy. Spicy flavors along with apples, and some honey to the finish. Overall it's overdone. ",Quinta do Noval 1971 Colheita  (Port),85,40,Port,Port, 1971
27,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"What it lacks in smoothness it makes up for in its chocolaty creaminess and cream-soda flavors. Notes of cloves, licorice and spicy fruit will please anyone looking for a good, basic sipper. A tad clunky, but likable. ",Cockburn's NV 10 Years Tawny  (Port),85,25,Port,Port,
28,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"One of this esteemed house's basic Ports, and it's by no means hard to enjoy. Some strawberry and red fruit on the young, rubbery nose. Tangy, with the requisite sweetness in the form of brown sugar. There's a dark coffee note on the finish. ",Warre's NV King's Tawny  (Port),85,13,Port,Port,
29,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Imagine brown sugar and raisins in liquid form. Not overly concentrated or complex, but thoroughly enjoyable. Mild tannins suggest this will be an early-maturing bottling. ",Martinez Gassiot 1995 Quinta da Chousa  (Port),86,40,Port,Port, 1995
30,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"All the basic berries and cream on the nose. Plush and rich, this is easy-drinking Port. Black plums and a big-time sweet core. Close to syrupy, but retains its balance. Smooth, well rounded, fruity and good. A nice dessert Port. ",Rozes 1994 Reserve Edition LBV  (Port),86,19,Port,Port, 1994
31,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Quite floral, offering hints of violets and black cherries. A reserved style, with a narrow band of fruit flavors and some dusty tannins to resolve. Try in five years, but will always be more fragrant than flavorful. ",Warre's 1986 Quinta Da Cavadinha Port (Douro),87,42,Douro,Port, 1986
32,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Simple and straightforward, with a clean, creamy body. The aromas and flavors of cinnamon, walnuts and burnt caramel conjure up memories of crème brûlée. Solid, as is the house style, if basic. ",Rozes NV Infanta Isabel 10 Year Tawny  (Port),87,25,Port,Port,
34,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A soft, aromatic tawny, with little to no aggressiveness. Flavors of oranges, caramel, nuts and chocolate make it more than easy to take. Almost nonexistent acidity yields a fluffy, almost hedonistic wine—yet it's only a 10-year-old. Best Buy. ",Feist NV 10 Years Old Port (Douro),89,19,Douro,Port,
35,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Quite concentrated; filled with dark-fruit flavors that offer hints of coffee, licorice and chocolate. Its moderately tannic nature suggests cellaring 5–10 years before peak maturity. ",Martinez Gassiot 1995 Quinta da Eira Velha  (Port),89,43,Port,Port, 1995
36,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Because it has been bottled without filtering, this Port has a chance to age. It has the opulent character of a Fonseca Port, enhanced by the fine vintage. Rich and full in the mouth, the wine's stewed blackberry and sweet plum flavors, both underlined by tannins, are sure to age well. Drink from 2021. ",Fonseca 2014 Late Bottled Vintage Unfiltered  (Port),91,24,Port,Port, 2014
37,14.0,Red,US,"Given time in bottle, this remains a hugely tannic and oak-influenced wine, woody with flavors of baked plum and black pepper. ",Prager 2013 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),84,36,California,Petite Sirah, 2013
38,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"While the aromas are somewhat medicinal, the palate shows touches of honey as well as acidity. It is an easygoing wine, with a bite of spirit at the end. ",Quinta Seara d'Ordens NV Fine White  (Port),85,12,Port,Port,
39,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This fruity wine, with its smooth texture, is simple and easygoing. Its lightness balances the honeyed character that gives the wine a ripe aftertaste. ",Quinta Santa Eufemia NV Fine White  (Port),85,15,Port,Port,
40,15.87,Red,US,"Port-like aromas give this 100% varietal wine a sense of sweetness, the texture viscous in baked black fruit. The oak is supportive and present, adding weight and breadth. ",Rock Wall 2017 Hendry Vineyard Block 29 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),86,45,California,Zinfandel, 2017
41,14.7,Red,US,"This superripe, almost Port-like wine exudes raisin and dried plum aromas and blackberry-jam flavors.

42,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,The wine has soft fruits and spirit giving lightness and freshness. Its touch of mango adds to the fruitiness at the end. ,Quinta da Pacheca NV White  (Port),86,15,Port,Port,
43,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is a soft sweet wine that has fine fruitiness, balanced between ripe orange and lemon-curd flavors. It is an attractive wine with enough acidity at the end. ",Quevedo NV Dry White  (Port),86,22,Port,Port,
44,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,This dry wine is strongly influenced by the wood aging. It shows in the acidity and in the bursts of freshness that come through. The aftertaste is tight and almost bitter. ,Bulas NV Dry White 10 Anos  (Port),86,36,Port,Port,
45,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A smooth rounded wine with honey as well as a dry core of spirit, this is balanced and ready to drink. Its acidity comes through to give the essential freshness. ",Quevedo NV White  (Port),86,22,Port,Port,

57,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Because this wine was bottled unfiltered, it certainly has a good chance of aging further. Even now, it is rich with sweetness and ripe prune flavors, while also keeping an edge of dry tannins. The wine is very much in the elegant style of the producer. Drink now or age until 2021. ",Ramos-Pinto 2014 R.P. LBV Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),91,25,Port,Port, 2014
58,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Largely from the producer's own Quinta dos Malvedos, the wine is elegant while also intensely rich. Its fine tannins, sweet black currant jelly flavors cut by acidity and touch of spirit in the background all give this wine great style and also the possibility of aging for a few more months. ",W. & J. Graham's 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),91,25,Port,Port, 2013
59,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Produced from the two vineyards that also supply Dow's Vintage Ports, this is a surprisingly light, fresh wine considering its age.

60,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is a wonderful wood-aged, mature Port full of the classic old gold flavors and intense acidity over a dry texture that is a signature of this producer. The wine is impressive, balanced and ready to drink. ",Dow's NV 20 Years Old Tawny  (Port),93,65,Port,Port,
61,14.0,Red,Portugal,"Better known for its Ports, this stunning upper Douro quinta also makes small amounts of still wine.

63,14.0,Red,Portugal,"Based on the magnificent Quinta de Roriz, this wine is a joint venture between the French Prats family and the Portuguese Symingtons.

Graham's 1994 Single Harvest Tawny  (Port),95,145,Port,Port, 1994
65,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This wine comes from a legendary year for Vintage Port, so it is fascinating to see how a wine from that year that was only bottled in 2018 has fared. The answer is amazingly. It is luscious and smooth, with fabulous old wood flavors blending with the ripe caramel and acidity. This in itself will be a wine of legend. ",W. & J.

66,13.0,Red,US,"This unusually dark-colored and potent-smelling wine pumps out overripe pruney Port-style aromas and apparently sweet, jammy boysenberry flavors that are not at all typical for the varietal.

86,14.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Firm and tannic, the wine is also full of fresh black currant fruit flavors.

268,19.5,Red,Portugal,"This wine, a field blend from old vines, is beautifully textured. It is made in a sweet, perfumed style, with dried fruits and prune flavors.

269,14.5,Red,Portugal,"With its north-facing aspect, this vineyard is just right for red wines rather than Port. A cool character comes through even in ageworthy wines such as this. Firm tannins mix in with the juicy red fruits and crisp aftertaste. Wood aging adds spice and rounds out the wine. Drink from 2021.

271,17.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Lively but standard amontillado aromas of maple, honey and nuts are a touch fiery. Matching the nose, this is choppy and pulling on the palate.

275,19.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A turbid brownish-gold color is cloudy but nothing else about this amontillado is unclear. Concentrated aromas of nut oil, pecan pie, molasses and sweat are rugged and raw. Blasting acidity creates pinch on the palate, while this tastes salty and like almonds, pecan pie and white pepper.

305,13.9,Red,US,"It's very difficult to rate this unusual bottling in a blind tasting. It's a nonvintage dry red wine blended from mature years and has few if any peers in California. It's very tasty because of traits that are usually considered flaws. A tawny color and an aroma like tawny Port lead to a very soft texture, and warm plum, raisin and nut flavors.

This gives a wine with huge concentration, dense flavors of sweet plums. The wood aging has softened the tannins, meaning that it is ready to drink.

357,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"It is still very young, but this wine has enormous potential, with its black fruit, flavors of crushed blackberries and wild cherries and layers of dense tannins. Give it at least 15 years. ",Quinta do Crasto 2001 Vintage Port Port (Douro),90,63,Douro,Port, 2001
358,16.0,Port/Sherry,US,"Decadance in a glass, a brutally delicious wine with flavors of cassis, sweet cherry pie, kirsch, and melted white chocolate sweetened with sugar.

359,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This wine is crammed full of honey and walnuts, accented by mixed berries. Fresh and lively, supple and smooth in the mouth, and not overly sweet despite ending on notes of maple syrup and roasted nuts. Much better than a bottle reviewed in the November 15, 2003 issue.

360,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Although 40% of the blend of Cockburn's 2000 “classic” vintage Port is from Quinta dos Canais, enough high-quality wine remained to bottle a single-quinta Port as well. Canais is slightly lighter in color and in weight, yet still boasts wondrous aromas of blueberries, licorice and sun-warmed schist. The wine's red berries wrapped around a chocolaty core should be hitting their stride in only five years or so. ",Cockburn's 2000 Quinta dos Canais Vintage  (Port),91,60,Port,Port, 2000
361,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"One of the pioneers of single-quinta Ports under the ownership of the Roseira family, Infantado's wines can be impressively powerful.

362,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"From a small, low-yielding parcel of old vines, this Port comes with huge intensity and concentrated flavors. It is dark, powerful and almost brooding.

369,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A solid, medium-weight offering that boasts supple tannins and pretty floral notes.

371,9.4,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"We don't see much white Port in this country, but in Portugal it's often served as an apéritif.

374,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This great quinta is owned by the Ferreira family and was the former home of the legendary table wine, Barca Velha. This 2001 is a great example of the power of the wines from this sun-baked vineyard. Young black fruits are balanced with perfumes and tarry flavors. It's dark, intense and likely to be long lasting.

378,,Port/Sherry,US,"Pale in color, but everything else is explosive. The cola, espresso, raspberry, vanilla and meringue flavors are soft in the way of an aged Port, yet firm with bracing acids.

393,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This 10-year-old tawny looks older, with some garnet at its core, but dominated by a pale amber hue.

397,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A brooding nose of sullen blackberries and earth presages a wine that shows wonderful balance between fruit, alcohol, acidity and tannin.

398,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Effectively a 25-year-old tawny, this wine starts off slowly, with restrained aromas of nuts and dried fruit.

",Cockburn's NV 20 Years Old Tawny Port  (Port),91,50,Port,Red Blends,
402,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This lushly fruity Port folds in enough intriguing floral aromas to be more than a simple fruit bomb. Briary notes add another element to the creamy boysenberry flavors that are incredibly rich but not cloying or syrupy. Likely to mature early but hold well, thanks to masses of supple tannins. Great quality for the price. ",Quinta do Vale Meão 2000 Vintage Porto Port (Douro),92,45,Douro,Port, 2000
403,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This dense wine is packed with fruit. The blackberry and anise aromas give an impression of the wine's impressive size that is confirmed on the palate. This seems sweeter than most vintages of Dow's flagship wine, but the extra sugar is balanced by big tannins. This is one single-quinta Port that doesn't seem destined for early drinking.

404,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Richly textured, verging on opulent, this should be a relatively early-maturing Port.

406,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"One of the vintage's standouts, the 2000 Quinta do Noval is incredibly rich and intense, with a density that made me think I should reach for a spoon. Chocoate and coffee, prune and date aromas; plum cake flavors. Despite the richness, there is a superb backbone of acidity and ripe tannins that suggests peak maturity is probably two decades or more away.

414,,Dessert,US,"This 100% Chardonnay looks and smells like a true late-harvest wine, with its dark golden color and decadent aromas of caramel, vanilla and meringue.

420,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Boasts youthful aromas of red fruits, with just a hint of golden raisins and toffee. Strikes a fine balance between vigorous young fruit and aged notes of caramel and raisin. ",Churchill's NV Tawny Ten Years Old Port (Douro),88,30,Douro,Port,
421,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Already showing hints of brown at the rim and the beginnings of decay on the nose, this is still eminently drinkable, especially if you prefer a little age on your Port.

423,19.9,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Cigar smoke, molasses and dried fig aromas set the stage for a smooth, easy-drinking tawny with layers of tobacco, dried citrus and clove flavors.

426,19.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Plums, dusty earth and dried spice mingle on the nose of this older release that actually seems more ageworthy than Portal's 1997 and 1999.

427,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"At 10 years of age, Portal's tawny is still showing some rough edges of youth; it's big and brawny, with plump cherry-berry fruit joined by citrus and caramel.

428,,Red,US,"A sweet, flavorful Port-style dessert wine. Opens with enticing aromas of cassis, chocolate, caramel, vanilla and smoke.

429,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A reasonably good buy in vintage Port, Silval is something of a second label for Quinta do Noval. It's less concentrated and suppler in the mouth than its sister wine, but still boasts compelling floral aromas allied to prune, berry and chocolate flavors. Worth trying a bottle before 2010.

430,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This 20-year-old shows some surprisingly youthful notes of red fruits along with layers of caramel, honey, maple syrup and walnuts.

431,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This young vintage Port is quite big, with plenty of lush fruit and some herb and spice notes.

432,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Barros's tawnies are worth seeking out. This young example shows the house's signature smoky, nutty aromas but adds more fruity scents of raisins and prunes. Supple in the mouth, with a long, toffee-filled finish. ",Barros NV 10 Years Old  (Port),90,25,Port,Port,
433,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Portuguese-owned Port houses, such as Barros, have long made terrific tawnies. This version is smoky and minerally, with nuts and citrus peel.

434,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Intentionally made in a friendly, fruit-forward style, Vau doesn't disappoint in 2000.

436,,Red,US,"Not a great success this vintage due to the baked, Porty aroma, with its suggestion of caramelized raisins, and Port-like, alcoholic flavors. Turns tannic and hot on the finish.

456,15.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"This is not a crisp, lean, clear fino. It has a yellowing color and rather uncommon minty, nutty aromas. Some light fruit flavors run the show, while blanched almond, green olive and saline offer support. The finish is long, but maybe a bit sour and hot for some palates.

More fruity than many, with a touch of mushroom. ",Osborne NV 10RF Oloroso Medium Sherry Sherry (Jerez),90,14,Andalucia,Sherry,
460,20.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Quite the classic, with rich toffee and nut-like aromas that come through with piercing power. The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality. This is a precise, somewhat reserved and dainty amontillado, but it's structured and quite real as far as style and impact.

461,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"The people at Hidalgo in Sanlúcar have taken dry Manzanilla and have let it age until it has turned golden and mature. The bouquet is full of exotic oils, nuts and some horsehide. In the mouth, it's a touch salty and astringent, but there are buttery, sweet undertones and great focus. And on the back end the pure flavor of mushroom and almonds is uncanny. Sleek, acidic and likely perfect with lobster or shrimp bisque. ",Vinícola Hidalgo NV Pastrana Manzanilla Pasada Sherry (Jerez),92,18,Andalucia,Sherry,
462,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"More sweet than semi-sweet, and very stylish. The nose offers a full blast of maple, citrus rind and honey, while the delicious palate overflows with dried apricot, fig, dates, pepper and chocolate. This is a sherry that excels in the area of mouthfeel: it's lithe, almost lean, but still packed and upright. And the finish, which is just spicy enough to offset the sweetness, goes on forever.

463,20.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Rich and unctuous; a big, muscular, semi-sweet beauty with a meaty frame and gorgeous maple and toffee aromas. Broad-shouldered across the palate, with apricot and quince flavors accented by cinnamon and nutmeg. In terms of mouthfeel, it's like a fine liqueur, and on the finish everything you've previously smelled and/or tasted comes back into perfect focus.

464,17.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A spectacularly sweet and rich bruiser, and one that delivers the essence of raisins, toffee and chocolate. This wine hasn't taken one turn south, and it's beckoning to be consumed. The finish is impeccably smooth and rich, and while its luscious to say the least, the amazing thing is its length, which runs a couple of minutes, no joke.

Try with, or over, vanilla ice cream, and be happy. —S.H. ",Mayo 2000 Ricci Vineyard Unfiltered Zinfandel Port Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),87,30,California,Zinfandel, 2000
552,18.5,Port/Sherry,US,"Real Portuguese Port-style aromas, with chocolate, blackberry, spice, and sweet vanilla aromas, and a fruity depth of flavor that pleases. ItÕs richly sweet, with a velvety texture and the high acids necessary to make things bright and balanced. A very nice bottle of dessert wine, highly recommended. ",Mount Palomar NV Limited Reserve Port (California),90,28,California,Port,
553,14.5,Red,US,"Is it overripe? After tasting it we're not entirely sure, but we detected aromas and flavors common to Port: mostly raisins, cough syrup and chocolate. Brighter-than-expected acidity, however, manages to balance off those heavy characteristics. ",Eric Ross 1999 Klapp Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),85,40,California,Pinot Noir, 1999
554,,Red,US,"Cherries and vanilla are all over the nose, so much so that it seems a little bit like Port. The plum and blackberry fruit is potent yet jammy, although ample acidity keeps it lively. Additional notes of tree bark, earth and dark chocolate add complexity. ",Bouchaine 1999 20th Anniversary Gee Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),86,50,California,Pinot Noir, 1999
555,14.6,Red,US,"This intensely extracted wine came off more like Port than Pinot to our tasters. Which isn't to say that it lacks appeal. It opens with smoked meat, spice cake and grilled nut aromas. Fat blackberry-plum flavors, a plush, low-acid mouthfeel and a full tannic finish complete the Port profile. It's tasty if overblown, and not what most people expect. Probably best paired with a cheese course. ",Siduri 2000 Cerise Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),86,50,California,Pinot Noir, 2000
556,13.0,Red,US,". “Overblown,” “full-throttle” and “juice-ball” are three words tasters used to describe this wine. But no one said it wasn't tasty. The black cherry flavors are almost overripe, but they are undeniably deep. Tons of spicy oak complements the fruit, adding to its almost Port-like quality. ",Steele 1999 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),88,28,California,Pinot Noir, 1999
557,14.1,Red,US,"This lush offering features some Port-like elements—chocolate, dried spices, rich, plummy fruit and a dense, creamy texture—but has enough acidity to retain its essential Pinot character. The tannins on the finish are so soft and ripe that you hardly notice them. Editors' Choice.

558,15.2,Red,US,"Big, bulky and slightly warm, this wine nevertheless delivers copious amounts of mouthfilling fruit.

",Foxen 2000 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),89,40,California,Pinot Noir, 2000
559,,Red,US,"A new winery from a trio with long years in the industry, but this is not a good start. Tastes like Port, with flavors of raisins.

",X 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),81,20,California,Cabernet Sauvignon, 2000
560,20.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This oldie isn't much of a goodie, and it goes to prove that holding wine beyond its time is a mistake. The aromas are strong and not very nice. The sweet, one-dimensional palate is still lively and relatively clean, but it lacks anything special. It may or may not have been better years ago. ",Croft 1983 Quinta da Roeda Port (Douro),82,56,Douro,Port, 1983
562,,Red,US,"A blend of Dry Creek and Alexander Valley grapes that were picked superripe, resulting in an almost Port-like wine, although thankfully they vinified it dry. The winemaker calls it “brooding and intense.” I find it cumbersome and awkward. But this alcoholic, big Zin perfectly illustrates one extreme of a school of thought in California, and you either like it or you don't.

571,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The color is a cross between violet and brick red. The nose is muddled, bordering on dull. The palate feel is on the heavy side. It seems a bit clumsy and chunky.

573,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"There's hardly any tawny color to speak of here; it's actually deep red, much like a dry table wine. On the palate, candied flavors mingle with powerful berries.

574,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The nose is bold more than stylish, powerful rather than seductive.  In the mouth, it's sweet, spicy and still very fruity. The body is a tad rough, with lively edges.

637,18.4,Port/Sherry,US,"A blend of five traditional Port varieties, this is a sweet (10% residual sugar), very rich wine of substance and harmony. It has massive flavors of berries with sweet overlays of caramel, chocolate and mint, and the sugars are nicely balanced by crisp acidity, although the texture is soft and velvety.

955,19.5,Dessert,US,"Shows real ruby Port-like character in the sweet, berry-cherry and chocolate flavors and vibrant acidity. The midpalate and finish are a little thin, though, so drink up. ",Pessagno 2003 Perelli-Minetti Vineyard Port (San Luis Obispo),85,32,California,Port, 2003
956,12.5,Red,US,"Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices. ",Bray 2005 Vino Tinto Red (Lodi),86,22,California,Red Blends, 2005
957,,Red,Portugal,"Ripe fruit, touched by vanilla, layered with dark tannins: this is a winning formula, a wine packed with black jelly flavors, made more tense by acidity and smoothed with the hint of wood. ",Dow's 2006 Vale do Bomfim Red (Douro),88,12,Douro,Portuguese Red, 2006
958,,Red,Portugal,"Deep, dusty wine, tannins dominating the fruit, giving a tough feel. There are some black currant flavors, but only just a hint. This definitely needs time to soften and broaden; give it 4–5 years. ",Prats & Symington LDA 2006 Post Scriptum Red (Douro),88,27,Douro,Portuguese Red, 2006
959,19.5,Dessert,US,"The great sweetness of this wine makes its success. It's just delicious, offering up a mouthful of chocolate-covered cherry candy flavors with the sharpness of cassis. Crisp acidity and fine, dusty tannins make it elegant. ",Pessagno 2002 Hames Valley Vineyard Port (Hames Valley),88,36,California,Port, 2002
960,19.5,Dessert,US,"Very sweet and delicious, a true Port-style wine that's high in acidity and packed with tannins. But the sugar level is so high, it makes the wine drinkable now. The flavors are of chocolate, red currants and vanilla. ",Pessagno NV 10 Year Tawny Port (Monterey),91,50,California,Port,

962,15.1,Red,US,"The name suggests certain proprietarily named Ports, and it's an apt descriptor for this muscular wine, which has superripe flavors of currants and raisins that veer into an overripe tartness. It's dry, but with very high alcohol. ",Karly 2005 Warrior Fires Zinfandel (Amador County),84,26,California,Zinfandel, 2005
963,15.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Light nut, saline and white pepper aromas start it out, and never does this fino reach that high level of refinement and style.

964,20.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A classy Sherry with full, attractive hazelnut and peanut oil aromas. The palate holds to that nuttiness while introducing maple and toffee flavors.

965,17.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Smooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate. Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue. ",Hidalgo NV Morenita Cream Sherry (Jerez),90,13,Andalucia,Sherry,
966,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Delicious, refined and sexy, but that's assuming you like palo cortado. Hidalgo's version is alluring and full of caramel, salt and hazelnut; it has an excellent feel, sensational acidity and a long, long finish of salted cashews and bitter spice.

968,15.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Licorice city on the nose, so much so that it smells like the real thing. In the mouth, it is thick as they come.

971,20.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Powerful and precise, but with a cloudy color. On the nose and in the mouth this aged version of the venerable Drysack shows considerable freshness, tang and complexity. It's edgy yet deep, with caramel and mushroom notes going head to head with acidic intensity. Sherry is rarely more balanced than this; it's lively and rich, balanced yet racy.

974,14.7,Red,US,"The wine is 100% Cabernet, a combination of the winery's Palisades vineyard, in Calistoga, and Graveyard Hill, in Carneros.

976,20.5,Dessert,US,"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors.

977,15.6,Red,US,"If you don't like the burn of high alcohol, avoid this wine. At 15.6%, it's almost like Port. On the other hand, it's a tasty Zin, chockful of lush cassis, milk chocolate, macaroon and vanilla fudge flavors, and is entirely dry.

980,16.4,Red,US,"It's necessary to talk about alcohol levels with Saxum's wines, because they define the style. With this one, it's 16.4%, higher than almost any commercially-released red table wine in California. That's almost Port. It's vast in chocolate, raspberry purée, cherry jam, anisette and cassis flavors. That makes it sound sweet, but it's dry and smoothly tannic. Saxum fans will exult. Others may find the wine problematic. ",Saxum 2005 James Berry Vineyard Rocket Block Red (Paso Robles),90,55,California,Rhône-style Red Blend, 2005

986,13.5,Red,Portugal,"Port producer Churchill owns this quinta, and makes both table wine and Port.

988,16.3,Red,US,"Consumers need to be warned that this Zin has 16.3% alcohol, which puts it nearly in Port territory. That aside, it's a good example of its style, which lots of people like.

993,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Vineyards don't get more remote than Ervamoira, in the heart of the Côa national park of prehistoric wall drawings.

997,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors. Finishes long and minerally, bolstered by slightly drying tannins.

998,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"In the Fonseca tradition, this is a hugely rich wine, very dense. It is not all weight, with excellently integrated firm tannins and a range of complex flavors, from nuts and berry fruits to full frontal ripeness. There is some dryness to finish.

999,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A powerhouse of a wine that goes from densely rich to massive without a pause. The ripe fruit, the dark, heavy tannins, the black plum and fig flavors, all come from the terroir of this great vineyard. ",Quinta do Vesuvio 2004 Vintage  (Port),94,62,Port,Port, 2004
1000,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Mouthfilling and round, without any sharp edges, but this wine remains extremely firm and dense, with several decades of life ahead of it. Dried fig, chocolate and black licorice flavors only hint at what lies ahead. ",Dow's 1997 Vintage  (Port),94,94,Port,Port, 1997
1001,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Perfectly mature, this Port's tannins have softened over the past 40-plus years, leaving it lushly textured and displaying rich fig and chocolate flavors.

",Dow's 1963 Vintage  (Port),95,467,Port,Port, 1963
1003,17.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish.

1005,19.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Caramel, molasses and spice aromas make this a totally approachable and familiar type of Sherry. The palate offers a round but zesty attack, with flavors of caramel, coffee, toffee, baked apple and orange peel.

1006,17.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks. ",Harveys NV Orange Apéritif Sherry (Jerez),84,15,Andalucia,Sherry,
1007,19.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Welcome back to the classic off-dry Sherry that helped make the category's reputation. It's amber in color, with toasted almonds, citrus peel and cinnamon on the nose.

1008,15.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Manzanilla Sherry (Jerez),90,10,Andalucia,Sherry,
1010,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Surprisingly light and soft, for a Dow Port, this shows sweet fruit with a super-ripe edge. In the medium-term, this will be a pleasant, ripe vintage, but it's not likely to age. ",Dow's 2005 Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira Vintage  (Port),87,60,Port,Port, 2005
1011,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A joint venture with the van Zeller and Symington families, this is a surprisingly airy, light wine which seems to miss weight and depth. Sweetness, black figs, lean. ",Quinta de Roriz 2004 Vintage  (Port),87,54,Port,Port, 2004
1012,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"On the outside this is all soft, generous round fruit. In the core, though, there is a strong acid, perfumed fruit character, which suggests aging potential.

1013,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Soft, superripe wine, with layers of sweet black figs and chocolate. This is almost like a Porty Zinfandel in its richness. There are tannins there, but they seem lost in this riot of sweet fruit. ",Rozes 2003 Vintage  (Port),88,80,Port,Port, 2003
1014,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A good choice for current consumption, the 1985 Dow's shows a touch of bricking to go along with developed aromas of cedar, clove and cinnamon.

1015,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"From a vineyard opposite Quinta do Vesuvio, high up the Douro, this Symington-owned property has produced a rich, sweet 2004, with a soft tannic structure, layered with a lightly spirit edge.

1016,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A classic, structured, well-shaped Port with its attractive dry tannins and firm, dark berry fruit.

1017,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Fruity, lacking the power of some vintages of Vargellas, but more than making up with richness, sweetness and delicious violet perfumes.

1018,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A dry, structured wine, firm and with tannic, concentrated fruit. Spirit and acidity are both evident, but with its dark, brooding style this is an impressive return to form by Croft. ",Croft 2004 Quinta da Roêda Vintage  (Port),91,45,Port,Port, 2004
1019,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is a superlative vineyard, and this wine shows its true character, a big, hearty wine, but one with a structured core of mineral, rich fruits and dark tannins.

1020,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"If at first the wine seems sweet and scattered, just give it time. Soon the nose will knit together to show mocha and that lightly oxidized elegance that is Oloroso.

1024,19.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Smooth and nutty, with deep secondary aromatics of apricot and orange peel.

1028,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"This is sweet Amontillado in fine form. The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee.

",California's Jewel 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),81,10,California,Cabernet Sauvignon, 2004
1037,15.0,Red,US,"Too hot and harsh by far. The blackberry and cherry fruit has a baked, stewed taste that finishes with searing, peppery heat. It's basically Port without the sweetness. ",Four Vines 2005 Biker Zinfandel (Paso Robles),82,24,California,Zinfandel, 2005
1038,15.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal. ",Harveys NV Fino Light Sherry (Jerez),83,15,Andalucia,Sherry,
1040,19.0,Dessert,US,"Made from Petite Sirah, with residual sugar of 8.5%, this wine's sweetness is pleasing, expressed through cassis, chocolate and raspberry fruit flavors.

1046,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Any fan of sweet Sherry should not turn a cheek against this jammy, figgy, rich wine that could use a cut of ice and citrus peel but isn't at all bad on its own.

1049,17.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"It's easy to throw high scores at almost any well-made P.X. because the wines are so viscous and overwhelmingly sweet.

1061,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"With its inky dark color, this is darkly dense, a huge mouthful of black fruits and dark, initially medicinal flavors and firm, concentrated tannins. It will age 20 years at least, but its sweet, ripe fruit suggest it could be drunk much earlier than that. ",Quinta do Noval 2004 Vintage  (Port),93,115,Port,Port, 2004
1065,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Remarkably, this is able to show age and long cask aging, but the flavor is still here: figs and honey, balanced out with burnt caramel aged acidity and a rich (but not sweet) finish. Excellent, top quality aged tawny. ",W. & J. Graham's NV 30-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),95,102,Port,Port,
1066,15.6,Red,US,"The fault with this enormous Zin is that despite a hefty 15.6% alcohol, it still tastes as sweet as a ruby Port. Fifty percent new oak only contributes caramel to what should properly be labeled a dessert wine. ",Vie Winery 2005 Beatty Ranch Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),82,39,California,Zinfandel, 2005
1067,14.5,Red,US,"This winery has been working for years with Barbera, but it's a tough grape to perfect in California. This shows the variety's rustic side, with briary flavors of wild berries and thick tannins. It's also sweet on the finish, like a simple Port. ",Scott Harvey 2005 J&S Reserve Barbera (Amador County),83,28,California,Barbera, 2005
1069,14.5,Red,US,"Almost as sweet as a Port, this has sugary flavors of very ripe blackberries and cassis. Nothing wrong with that, except that it's not really a dry table wine. If the sweetness doesn't bother you, the wine is rich and voluptuous, with smooth tannins. ",Daniel Gehrs 2005 Merlot (Santa Barbara County),85,25,California,Merlot, 2005
1070,18.0,Dessert,US,"Like a good tawny Port, this dessert wine has an attractive aroma of caramelized blackberries, roasted nuts, candied tangerine zest and cola. Turns rich and balanced in the mouth, with brisk acidity that makes the sweetness clean. ",Hunt Cellars 2000 Good Vibrations Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),90,50,California,Cabernet Sauvignon, 2000
1071,20.0,Dessert,US,"Made with Portuguese varieties, this is a real Port-like wine. It's supersweet, just fabulously rich in blackberry, chocolate, coffee and vanilla flavors, and all that richness is beautifully balanced with crisp acids and smooth, succulently ripe tannins. The finish goes on. A great price. ",Daniel Gehrs 2004 Fireside Port (Amador County),94,31,California,Port, 2004
1072,15.9,Red,US,"Unacceptably high in alcohol, nearly 16%, this Zin is overwhelmed with heat. It's almost Port, without the luscious fruit, and burns the palate. ",Mill Creek 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),80,30,California,Zinfandel, 2005
1073,18.0,Dessert,US,"Not too many Port-style wines are made from Chardonnay, as this one is. The residual sugar is 6%, but it's not a very good wine. Tastes cooked or stewed in pineapple, and the high alcohol makes for a burnt feeling. ",Prager 2003 White Port (Napa Valley),83,48,California,Port, 2003
1074,18.9,Red,US,"Sweet, with an intense sugary edge to the cherry and cassis flavors, this Zin-Syrah blend has a simple finish. ",Fralich 2003 Harry's Concierge Port (Paso Robles),84,25,California,Port, 2003

1076,20.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Big and ripe, but also well structured, this is the style of LBV that could age in bottle. It has powerful black fruits, acidity and a dry core surrounded by the rich sweetness. ",Ferreira 1999 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),89,22,Port,Port, 1999

1079,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A great mouthful of sweet fruit, flavors of ripe figs and tannins are almost lost in this delicious wine.

",Kopke 2004 Quinta São Luiz Vintage  (Port),90,58,Port,Port, 2004
1080,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"There is great balance between the ripeness, dark plum flavors and fine acidity. An intense wine, with easy tannins that are dusty, rather than dry. ",Ferreira 2000 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),90,70,Port,Port, 2000
1081,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is a mature, deliciously perfumed and structured wine. There is a great milk chocolate flavor that balances the flavors of candied fruits. ",Taylor Fladgate 2000 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),90,23,Port,Port, 2000
1082,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is like a junior vintage. Because Niepoort bottles its LBVs unfiltered, they have ripeness and balance, while the fruit has great concentration of flavor. This is very rich with many black fruit and dark plum flavors, but at the same time it has a core of structure and tannin, which suggests that it could age. Bottled in 2006.

1083,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Impressively structured, packed with dark, heavy tannins, this is an aromatic Port. The initial black plum fruit and spice flavors are dominated by the structure, promising a good aging potential. ",Cálem 2000 Vintage  (Port),90,48,Port,Port, 2000
1084,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Although with its vintage date, this is only 10 years' old, don't think of this as another 10-year-old aged tawny. Like most colheitas, aged in wood and not topped up with new wine as are aged tawnies, this is much more concentrated, like  syrup. It has some sweetness, but the dominant character is dark Belgian chocolate. Very dense, with a very dry aftertaste. ",Barros 1996 Colheita  (Port),90,23,Port,Port, 1996
1085,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"For freshness, it is worth buying this young LBV. It has all the structure needed, a dark chocolate undertone, but it is the fresh black fruits and the lift of acidity that make it so attractive. ",Taylor Fladgate 2002 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),91,23,Port,Port, 2002
1086,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A great LBV, intense and concentrated, with dark plum skin flavors, dried raisins and cocoa. This is very much a wine that is in the dry style of Dow's Ports. ",Dow's 2001 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),91,20,Port,Port, 2001
1087,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is all about power and rich fruit. A great depth of flavor, dark and brooding, but also with great sweetness and richness. This is an outstanding powerful wine, which will age. ",Fonseca 2001 Unfiltered Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),92,22,Port,Port, 2001
1088,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is too young to have the true taste of a vintage-dated Colheita. It is almost a young tawny, both in color and taste. As such, it is a pleasant wine, with good ripe, sweet fruits, sultanas. At the finish, the spirit is too dominant. ",Burmester 1998 Colheita  (Port),84,35,Port,Port, 1998
1089,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The simplest of the Ferreira range of Ports, but still a bright fresh red fruit-flavored wine with a smooth texture. Good raisins and very soft tannins. ",Ferreira NV Ruby  (Port),84,14,Port,Port,

1095,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Soft and very smooth, perfumed with rosehips and black figs. There's some burnt character, but more of the soft, sweet, treacly style of tawny. ",Burmester NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),87,35,Port,Port,

1100,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Generally, 2004 is not a classic vintage Port year, but there are some very good ones around. This is soft, ripe and with good tannins.

1107,15.5,Red,Portugal,"A huge wine, full of soft fruit. The layers of tannins sit gently on the plum and cassis fruits, lifted by acidity.

1109,15.5,Red,US,"We're almost into Port here, not only in the alcohol level, but the flavors. The blackberries, strawberries, raspberries and cherries are almost raisiny, with that taste of plumped dried fruit, leading to a finish of raspberry liqueur. Yet the wine is dry, as well as tannic. There are certainly few Zinfandels like this anywhere, and you'll either like it or you won't.

1110,14.0,Red,Portugal,"The darkest, most impressive version of the Duas Quintas brand, this Reserva is made in the open lagars, from foot-trodden grapes in the tradition still used by major Port houses.

1114,,Red,US,"This easy-drinking Zinfandel starts off with heady, almost Port-like aromas of berries and spice, then continues that theme on the palate, but with reasonable alcohol levels and moderate body.

1116,17.0,Red,US,"With 17% alcohol, this Zin still has residual sugar. They must have picked the grapes insanely ripe. It's not a table wine, it's more like Port, but it's not without its pleasures.

1117,15.8,Red,US,"Way too hot and alcoholic, almost Port-like, this is the victim of excessive alcohol (15.8%) that makes it burn like a chili pepper.

1125,18.1,Port/Sherry,US,"I want to like this wine more than I do, because it starts off so sweet and ripe in chocolate-infused blackberry jam and cassis flavors.

1131,13.5,Red,US,"Tasted with Conn Creek's Yountville Cab, this is the lesser bottling, probably due to the vintage. It was warm to hot, and this Cab has notes of overripe chocolate-covered raisins and Port.

It's tremendous in very sweet blackberry jam, cassis, cherry liqueur, chocolate, vanilla cream and cola flavors, with a fabulous Asian spiciness.

1140,15.1,Red,US,"Just a bit too ripe and hot, which gives it a superficial deliciousness of fruit, but the underlying structure prevents complexity and longevity.

1146,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is very much in the mold of the 1992—maybe slightly less rich but just by a whisker. It's dense without being heavy, with a beautifully spice-filled and long finish.

1147,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This wine's dark garnet color with minimal bricking suggests a relatively youthful wine and this certainly could age longer, although it's also delicious now.

1437,20.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Opens with a wonderful set of nutty, dry aromas along with pit fruits like nectarine, apricot and peach.

1439,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"As is normal with Warre's LBV, this is bottled with a sediment, meaning it can age in the bottle.

1440,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Sandeman's aged tawnys have a definite dryness, the wood an important part of the wine. While they are dry, the weight of rich, dried fruit flavors gives a good balance. Acidity mingles with the fruit, enriching the burnt character, giving a wine that is intensely rich rather than sweet. ",Sandeman NV 30-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),91,100,Port,Port,
1441,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Old Colheitas are often only sipping wines, ones to admire. That's the case here, because there is a medicinal character that comes from extreme concentration.

",Barros 1963 Colheita  (Port),91,215,Port,Port, 1963
1442,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The aromas are all of long beneficial wood aging, the fruit character replaced by wood acidity, while keeping intense richness.

1444,19.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Angular but super clean. The nose shows a little sharpness, but that's an indicator that what's to come is tight and lasting. In the mouth, this is a huge, defined wine.

1447,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A soft, sweet style of LBV that goes for red fruits, soft tannins and ripeness. The spirit is rather aggressive here, maybe from recent bottling, and the fruit feels almost put to one side. ",Cálem 2003 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),85,16,Port,Port, 2003
1448,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A tawny style, with some dried raisin and wood-aged acidity. Essentially, though, the wine is soft and sweet in the Burmester style.

1449,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"With its green edge, this is not a ripe vintage wine. Certainly, the fruit is dense and sweet, but there is always the feeling of astringency, black currant juiciness that does not suggest aging. ",Burmester 2005 Vintage  (Port),85,90,Port,Port, 2005
1450,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A solid, rich wine, finely balanced. Its dried currant flavors are well integrated into the firm, dry structure.

1453,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"On the drier side of aged tawnys, this is a wine with wood, dried raisin and noticeable spirit. It has reviving acidity from the wood, just showing rich sweetness on the finish. ",Cálem NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),87,23,Port,Port,
1454,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Because of its relative youth (for a wood-aged Colheita), this is almost a Late Bottled style, with ruby color and a fruity, red berry character.

1455,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Sweet, surprisingly soft for its age, this shows light wood tannins, spice and dried fruits, followed by just an edge of the spirit. It is fresh, elegant, a pleasingly perfumed wine, but not exciting. ",Burmester 1963 Colheita  (Port),87,790,Port,Port, 1963
1456,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Smells and tastes semisweet, with vanilla and molasses on the nose. The palate runs sweet as well, with root beer, brown sugar and brownie flavors.

1457,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This has a fine bite, offering its richness on the edge of a knife.

1459,18.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Lustau calls it dry but Los Arcos definitely has some aromatic and palate sweetness. The nose settles on brown sugar, peach, mixed nuts and honey.

1461,20.0,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"An elegant Port, its fruit and firm tannins blending effortlessly with blackberry jelly and spice flavors.

1464,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Toffee, caramel and good maturity on this sophisticated wine. There is a spirit edge, but it works because the fruit is subservient to the maturity, ripeness and richness. The aftertaste is just perfumed. ",Wiese & Krohn NV Lagrima  (Port),90,16,Port,Port,

1471,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A supreme wine that tastes of intense maturity, touched with oxidation. It has gained in color as it ages, so now it is a deep green gold.

The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out.

1730,8.0,Dessert,US,"Good for its apricot, vanilla and buttercream flavors, but really lacks the sweet richness that an expensive dessert wine needs.

1734,18.5,Port/Sherry,US,"Smooth and velvety, with chocolate-cherry flavors, but the sweetness tails off quickly, disappointing the palate.

1737,15.5,Red,US,"At the age of five-plus years, this Petite Sirah remains drily tannic and hot in alcohol, offering little relief. It's so thin in fruit, it's hard to find much to like. ",Prager 2005 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),82,22,California,Petite Sirah, 2005
1738,13.9,Red,US,"Made from one of the Port grape varieties, this wine is simple, soft and candied. It has raspberry and chocolate flavors, with a hit of anise and white pepper.

1740,14.9,Red,US,"This is a spiritous Zinfandel, in the sense it feels richly soft, unctuous and alcoholic in the mouth, and there's a sweetness to the cherries and chocolate that's almost Port-like, in a good sense.

1742,14.5,Red,Portugal,"A beautifully smooth wine, with a rich Port-like texture.

1745,15.5,Red,US,"Frankly as sweet as Port, with sugary blackberry jam and chocolate-covered raisin flavors and high, brandied alcohol. Not bad for a dessert wine, but inappropriate for a table wine. ",Wilson 2007 Dorothy's Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),83,30,California,Syrah, 2007
1746,16.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab. In the mouth, the flavors strike as sour and sharp, but also musty and weak. With so many fine Sherries available, this one seems like a laggard.

1748,20.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers. ",Williams & Humbert NV Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Olorosso Aged 15 Years Sherry (Jerez),90,25,Andalucia,Sherry,
1749,17.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.

1750,15.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on.

",González Byass NV Nectar Dulce Pedro Ximénez (Jerez),91,18,Andalucia,Pedro Ximénez,
1751,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas.

1752,18.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice.

1753,20.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune.

",González Byass NV Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo Sherry (Jerez),93,45,Andalucia,Sherry,
1754,15.5,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.

1758,15.3,Red,US,"Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness. Clumsy now, but sometimes these wines improve in the long run.

1759,13.5,Red,US,"Dry and sharp in acidity, this rustic wine needs rich meats and cheeses to clip its claws. Made from traditional Port varieties, it's quite rich in cherry, red currant and spice flavors. An interesting wine, and one that you wish were made with greater attention to detail. The appellation is within Lodi. ",Lee Family Farm 2008 Rio Tinto Silvaspoons Vineyard Red (Alta Mesa),86,16,California,Red Blends, 2008
1760,15.7,Red,US,"Made in a superripe, high-alcohol style, this Zin may be an acquired taste, but if you like this approach, it's a sensation. Dry, soft and a little hot, it shows massive blackberry tart, black cherry pie, blueberry jam, chocolate, anise, pepper and Indian spice flavors. Almost Port-like, but never loses essential control, and a fine example of Dry Creek. ",Gustafson Family 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),92,36,California,Zinfandel, 2007

1763,15.6,Red,US,"Smells and tastes hot and cooked, as if some of the grapes shriveled on the vine and weren't properly sorted out. Otherwise, you'll find flavors of blackberry jam and dry Port. ",Eagle Castle 2007 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),82,35,California,Petite Sirah, 2007
1764,16.5,Red,US,"Super-ripe and dry, with raisin and Port flavors wrapped into 16.5% alcohol. It's a good example of what it is, but certainly exceeds balance. ",Wine Guerrilla 2008 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),82,30,California,Zinfandel, 2008

1769,14.0,Red,Portugal,"The second wine of the Bruno Prats and Symington family joint venture, this is a deliciously fruity wine, but with a fine elegant backbone of light tannins and smoky wood.

1770,19.5,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Initially, this is a fruit-dominated wine, with a cherries-in-syrup flavor.

1771,20.0,Dessert,US,"Made from traditional Portuguese varieties, this is one of the best California Port-style wines out there, which is no surprise coming as it does from sweet wine specialist Quady.

1772,14.0,Red,Portugal,"Chryseia is a benchmark wine in modern Douro table wine making.

1774,14.8,Red,US,"Although this Zinfandel is technically dry, it tastes sweet, like a black cherry tart complexed with cinnamon, brown sugar, anise, vanilla and a splash of rum. The richness is balanced by firm tannins and good acidity. Still, that sweetness reprises on the finish, with a hit of port. Ready now. ",Dashe Cellars 2007 Florence Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),86,32,California,Zinfandel, 2007
1777,16.5,Red,US,"The problem with this wine is excessive alcohol. Officially, it's 16.5%, which is almost Port. However, this Zin is dry. Yet it can't outrun the taste of overripe raisins.

1778,16.0,Red,US,"The first thing to know about this Zinfandel is its extraordinarily high alcohol. The official reading is 16%. It's almost Port, except that it's bone dry.

",Wilson 2007 Ken's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),88,44,California,Zinfandel, 2007
1779,16.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas.

1780,16.0,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Starts out a bit sweaty and leathery, but soon it turns more smoky.

1785,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A deliciously rich, sweet and youthfully fruity wine that has an opulent feel to it. There is a juicy element, with fresh acidity, but most of the character comes from the ripe fruit, the jelly character and the sweet tannins. It needs more bottle age.

1790,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Initially it seems very dry, but there is freshness as well. The wine has a sweet, jelly core, with soft tannins, well balanced.

1793,,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Bottled unfiltered (which means there is a sediment in the bottle), this is a fine wine, on the dry side, with firm tannins, fresh acidity and flavors of dried fruits.

1906,16.0,Red,US,"This Syrah-Grenache blend is enormously rich, ripe and heady. It wears its 16% abv well, without ever feeling hot or awkward.

1907,16.2,Red,US,"Blended mainly from Grenache, with 20% Syrah, this is one of the biggest, most extracted red wines ever to come out of Paso Robles. The alcohol is a ridiculously high 16.2% by volume, but it's balanced the same way that high alcohol in Port is balanced. The flavors are enormously rich with raspberry and cherry jam, white chocolate and buttered toast. Heady and flashy in that distinctly California mode, and made for drinking now.

1911,14.7,Red,US,"With sharp acidity, a hot mouthfeel and rich flavors of cassis liqueur and chocolate-covered raisins, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend tastes more like Port than a dry table wine.

1997,18.0,Port/Sherry,US,"A compelling Port-like wine made from Petite Sirah, ZInfandel and Syrah grapes aged more than 10 years to form this mix of almonds and sweet apple pie laced with caramel, smooth and easy to drink and pleasant in its Armagnac-like aromas.

The aromas are subtle, suggesting blackberries, but the flavors go deep into more blackberries, ripe red cherries and Santa Rosa plums accented with just a dash of cinnamon-like oak.

2518,14.7,Port/Sherry,US,"Mouthfilling, mouthcoating and full bodied, this dark-colored wine blends ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors with dark chocolate and baking-spice nuances for a complex and delicious taste profile. It's rich enough in flavor and viscous enough in texture that the abundant tannins seem to be absorbed, and the mouthfeel is soothing. Best from 2018–2023.

Cheesy aromas set up a palate with blazing acidity. That leads to sourness that adorns flavors of salt and peanuts. Despite the fancy packaging, this doesn't come across as anything better than good.
